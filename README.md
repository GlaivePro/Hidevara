# Hidevara

> Even though Laravel >=6.x includes Ignition which no longer dumps your variables, it requires Whoops itself. And in some cases you can still get to the old error page with variables dumped.

Laravel millipackage that hides your variables from getting dumped in the Whoops page when your app crashes.

`Hidevara` is japonese for `hide the damn vars`.

## Usage

Install it:

``` bash
$ composer require glaivepro/hidevara
```

To deal with the cases where the app crashes before loading providers, you should open your `bootstrap/app.php` and extend the handler. Find these rows (or something similar with another namespace if you've changed that):
```php
// This is already there
$app->singleton(
    Illuminate\Contracts\Debug\ExceptionHandler::class,
    App\Exceptions\Handler::class
);
```

Immediately after that insert these lines to extend the handler:
```php
// Enable only outside testing as this does not work well with phpunit... see below
if ('testing' != env('APP_ENV'))  // this will work even with config caching
	$app->extend(
		Illuminate\Contracts\Debug\ExceptionHandler::class,
		function($handler) {
			return new GlaivePro\Hidevara\HidingHandler($handler);
	});
```

By default this package will:

- leave your GET and FILES intact;
- hide value of any POST field that has a name containing `password`;
- hide values of SESSION and COOKIE;
- remove almost all SERVER variables (except REDIRECT_STATUS, REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY_STRING, REQUEST_URI);
- remove all ENV variables.

"Hide" means that the value will be replaced with a string. By default it's empty string for null/emptystring values and `[hidden]` for everything else.

## Customization

Publish the config:

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="GlaivePro\Hidevara\Provider"
```

Now you've got your very own `config/hidevara.php` file to edit. 

You'll see a set of rules (`'action' => $test`) associated with each of the variables. The test can be an array of exact field names, string with a regex or `true` to take this action for anything.

Here's an example:

```php
	'_GET' => [                   //this is the ruleset for fields in GET
		'expose' => true,         // show all fields
	],

	'_ENV' => [
		'remove' => ['APP_KEY'],  // remove key field entirely
		'hide' => '/password/i',  // hide anything that matches regex contains password
		'trash' => '/PUSHER/'     // anything that's not 'expose' or 'hide' will remove matched fields
		'expose' => true,         // expose all that remains
	],
	
	'_SERVER' => [
		'expose' => ['REQUEST_METHOD'],  // show the REQUEST_METHOD
		                                 // everything that hasn't matched a rule will be removed
	],
```

There are also `replaceHiddenValueWith` and `replaceHiddenEmptyValueWith` where you can supply whatever strings you love (like üçë).

## Changes to error handling

To hide the global variables from Whoops, they are hijacked/ruined just before calling your `Handler::render()`. If you need access to the original global at that method, you can get them in `$GLOBALS['hidevara']`. For example, `$GLOBALS['hidevara']['_SERVER']` is what `$_SERVER` was.

## Working with PHPUnit

Sometimes (supposedly when an exception is raised) this package crashes PHPUnit. To prevent this, we are not enabling the custom handling when the environment is `testing`.

If you do need to enable this while running PHPUnit, the errors can be prevented by setting `processIsolation="true"` on the `<phpunit>` tag in your `phpunit.xml`.

## Collaboration

Pls help! Here are the open problems and questions:

- We should make a console command that fixes `app\bootstrap.php`. Can we force calling it in the provider if needed?
- What should the default config be?
- Should config allow repeating the same type of rule? It's possible but would make config syntax more complicated.
- Are there better ways to do this in Laravel? 
- Can we intercept directly in the Whoopsies `PrettyPageHandler` and make this not Laravel specific?
